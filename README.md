## Technologies

### Next.js

Next.js is a React framework that simplifies the process of building React applications by providing automatic code
splitting, server-side rendering, development hot reloading. It allows developers to create web applications with a
modern development experience that have improved load time, performance, and SEO, while being easy to deploy to a
variety of hosting platforms. Additionally, it has a large and active community and a wide range of plugins and
libraries that can be added, making it easy to find help and solutions to any problem that may arise.

### TailwindCSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-defined CSS classes for quickly building user
interfaces, it is also highly customizable and promotes consistency, scalability, performance and accessibility in
design. It simplifies the styling process by allowing developers to focus on layout and spacing, rather than styling
individual elements.

### Redux

Redux is a library that helps manage the state of an application by providing a centralized store and tools for updating
state in a predictable way, it helps keep state organized and easy to manage even in complex applications, also it
allows for undoing/redoing actions, better debugging, and scalability.
